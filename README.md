# TBC

Rapid prototype for side project. Gone all full stack. Chasing that unicorn. Full coverage. Design, ux, front-end, back-end, devops and sysops. Interim conventional build based in Adonis.js removes complications whilst in the conceptual phase. There is a LOT to work through and flesh out... learning Adonis/Laravel, dealing with relational DBs and advanced queries, implementing authentication and authorisation flows with oAuth, instant messaging system with websockets/long polling and not to mention designing and architecture on the fly. Once there is enough form, substance and definition to proudly call a MVP. Endpoints will be exposed and Vue(probably Nuxt) incorporated. The ultimate desire is an isomorphic implementation in Vue 3.

Of course if things ever gets close to that stage this will be moved to a private repo. However as a mule for my own self-development and a proof of concept this repo can remain publically visible for the timebeing.
